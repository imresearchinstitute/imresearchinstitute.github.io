# Current research and development:

TNN - Time based (sequence/temporal) Neural Network software. Includes java source and bash util scripts. Uses tanh threshold function.

Freex - minimal linux distro (SUSE based). Name is homage to Linus original linux free(uni)x distro.

IO - (Interpreted Objects) - an object oriented interpreted (scripting) language with the following features: K&R style syntax, all objects (pure, no primitives), package is reflected file system path, built in reflection (getClass(), getMethod()), runs from command line (ie, #!/bin/io). In development.

Kilgore -  Natural Language Processing (NLP), liguistic expression parsing and contextual matching. Currently porting to Python, Javascript.

TextGen - generate grammatical phrases from language database. Currently porting to Python.

Mathematics - Algorithms and analysis of prime and twin prime number distribution at given points, within an infinite sequence.

Brain Wave - study of external sensory stimuli (audio/visual) for induction of brain states and target frequencies; including binarual, pulse, ASRM, descending tones, square/sine wave; and strobe video.

NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Location Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt MD: 
Provided software development and support for Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope and SOHO Solar and Heliospheric Observatory projects. Transitioned SOHO spacecraft simulator software from Solaris to CentOS 7 Linux environment. Transitioned Fermi moc software from Redhat 5 32-bit environment to Redhat 7 64-bit environment. Developed in Linux Redhat/Centos and Solaris Unix environments. Developed with C, C++, python, bash, korn shell and perl.

NOAA Center for Climate Prediction - CyberData
Location University Research Court, College Park, MD: 
Provided scientific software design and development for CyberData Technologies, at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Center for Climate Prediction (NCEP) Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System II (AWIPS II). Implemented enhancements to predictive and observational (ie, satellite) data, for AWIPS II graphical display, ingest and analysis processes, coded in Java, XML, SQL (postgres), bash, Python and Perl. Development is in the Linux (Redhat) environment with Eclipse (Mars release).
